"""Regression test for the Mar 2026 restructure bug.

In commit b3edc0a the public repo stripped all Pro modules, which moved
license handling from ``omega.license`` to ``omega_platform.license``
(the latter ships in the Pro wheel). Several call sites in the public
CLI and server were left behind still importing ``omega.license``, a
module that no longer exists anywhere. Pro customers who ran
``omega activate <key>`` without the Pro wheel installed saw the cryptic
error "License activation requires omega-pro." with no path forward.

This test scans the public ``omega`` package for any lingering
``from omega.license import ...`` statements so the bug cannot come
back. It is pure AST, runs in milliseconds, and has no runtime deps.
